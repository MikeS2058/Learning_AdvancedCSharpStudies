# **Answer: Tell the agent to review QUICK_REFERENCE.md first.**


Based on the DIRECTORY_MAP.md and the documentation structure I created, the file you should instruct an agent to review first is:
QUICK_REFERENCE.md
This is marked with a ⭐ in the directory map and is specifically designed as the "START HERE" entry point. It provides:
A fast 3-step overview
Essential setup commands
Common mistakes to avoid
Quick navigation to other resources
However, if the agent needs a visual understanding of what's in the directory and how files are organized, you could alternatively start with:
DIRECTORY_MAP.md (the current file)
This gives a complete visual structure with file categories and purposes.

Recommendation for different scenarios:
For quick setup: QUICK_REFERENCE.md
For orientation: DIRECTORY_MAP.md or INDEX.md
For comprehensive understanding: README.md
For step-by-step copying: SETUP_GUIDE.md
For customization: CUSTOMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md
The recommended reading order in DIRECTORY_MAP.md shows:
QUICK_REFERENCE.md ← Start here for fast action
README.md
SETUP_GUIDE.md
CUSTOMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md
INDEX.md
REVIEW_SUMMARY.md
