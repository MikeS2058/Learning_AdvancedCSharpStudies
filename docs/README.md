# Documentation

This folder contains all project documentation, summaries, and architectural decisions.

## Files in This Folder

### REPOSITORY_SETUP_SUMMARY.md
Complete summary of the AITransfer configuration setup process, including:
- Configuration files copied and customized
- Placeholder replacements
- BOM encoding issue resolution
- Verification steps
- Next steps for development

## Purpose

Following the project guidelines, all summary and technical documentation belongs in the `docs/` folder rather than cluttering the repository root. The root `README.md` should remain focused on user-facing information.

## Adding Documentation

When creating new documentation files:

1. **Create in this folder**: `docs/[NAME]_SUMMARY.md` or `docs/[TOPIC].md`
2. **Use descriptive names**: `FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`, `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc.
3. **Include metadata**: Date, purpose, related files
4. **Keep focused**: One topic per document
5. **Update this README** if the document is important for the team

## Documentation Types

- **Summaries**: Implementation summaries, refactoring summaries, feature summaries
- **Technical Docs**: Architecture decisions, design patterns, technical specifications
- **Guides**: Migration guides, setup guides, troubleshooting guides
- **Change Logs**: Major changes, breaking changes, version history
